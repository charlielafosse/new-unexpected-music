### New unexpected music ðŸŒž

An overdue refactor and redesign of [prunus mume: unexpected music](https://github.com/charlielafosse/prunus-mume-unexpected-music).

This project is deployed on [Netlify](https://serene-einstein-392a36.netlify.com/)

#### Cool stuff ðŸ”¥

- Having only used Heroku for all things deployment so far, I gave Netlify a try. It's nice and uncluttered to use, and I was able to deploy within minutes.

- Revisiting code I wrote nearly a year and a half ago and totally refactoring all that old, ugly stuff into sweet React components.

#### Run this project locally

- Clone
- `npm i` dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start

### New unexpected music ðŸŒž

An overdue refactor and redesign of [the first project](https://github.com/charlielafosse/prunus-mume-unexpected-music) I ever created.

This project is deployed on [Netlify](https://serene-einstein-392a36.netlify.com/)

#### Cool stuff ðŸ”¥

- Having only used Heroku for all things deployment so far, I gave Netlify a try. It's nice and uncluttered to use, and I was able to deploy within minutes.
- Totally refactoring all the old, ugly JS into React components.

#### To do

- Better colours
- Better sizing of bubbles and spacing?
- Better font
- Footer
